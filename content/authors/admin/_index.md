I am political scientist in the Otto-Suhr-Institut für Politikwissenschaft at the Freie Universität Berlin. I handed in my dissertation on the digital social contexts in modern election campaigns in summer 2021. My research focuses on political communication, attitudes and behaviour - specifically in and around electoral campaigns.

I teach undergrad courses at Freie Universität Berlin, namely "Introduction in Political Communication" and "Election Campaign Research" and previously taught introductory courses on statistics at the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz.
